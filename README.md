# pygame-space-invaders
A simple 2D game made using PyGame. I created it in order to develop a better understanding of this library. I am providing the source code and all the assets (images, wound effects) that you need for learning purposes. 
I do not intend to benefit from it financially. If you download the source code please use it for personal purposes (non commercial).

I used rectangles instead of my own Classes/objects because they had some important built-in functions. 
It would make me really happy if I helped at least one person with his struggle for learning PyGame. I tried so that my code is understandable by adding comments and detailed variable names.
I know, it is not perfect but it is up to you to imporve it, I have faith in your abilities ðŸ˜‰
Happy Coding and remember that learning in deep fundamental stuff takes time, be patient.
